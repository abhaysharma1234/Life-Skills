# Tiny Habits

### Question 1
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
### Answer 1
The most interesting idea for me was how Motivation and Ability are inversely proportional, and how the easier a thing is to do the lesser motivation we have for it.
I can get easily motivated about the idea of me benchpressing a 100 kgs, but it's tough to sustain the motivation until I reach my desired level of strength to do so.
Whereas, going to the roof to get some sun is an easy task, which is why there's very low motivation to do so.

### Question 2
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
### Answer 2
M, A and P stand for Motivation, Action and Prompt(Trigger) respectively.
We can undertand the underlying relationship between these 3 factors that constitute a behaviour and further our habit establishment efforts.
We can keep the Action low, Motivation high, and an effective and unmissable prompt to make making new habits easier.

### Question 3
Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
### Answer 3
It's important to "Shine" as it enforces the successful habit as a positive behvaiour or something that we would want to repeat in the future.
"Shine" helps in growing motivation and as a result lets us tackle bigger tasks with time.

### Question 4
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
### Answer 4
Failure Premortem, imagine yourself 6 months from now, and figure out what might have caused you to fail then you already have a advantage when you're starting.

### Question 5
What is the book's perspective about Identity?
### Answer 5
Identity is what defines our behaviour, but it is also the other way around. How we behave enforces our identity. The book points out how identity is at the core of our behaviour and how we should aim to reshape our identity rather than the outcome.

### Question 6
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
### Answer 6
We need to make the habit, obvious and visisble, attractive and enjoyable, simple and small, and finally, rewarding and satisfying.

### Question 7
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
### Answer 7
We need use friction to our advantage and introduce as much of it as possible to make a bad habit harder to do

### Question 8
Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
### Answer 8
I want to make good habits like writing in my diary and reading books every day. I can keep my diary or book near my pillow or with my morning tea so I remember easily. I will make it fun by using a nice pen, a comfortable place, or coffee. I will start with small steps, track my days, feel happy for small progress, and try not to break my daily habit.

### Question 9
Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
### Answer 9
I would like  to do less of eating outside food.
I can make it invisble by eliminating food apps on my phone.
